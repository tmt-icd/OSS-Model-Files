// --- Alarms ---

//  OSS shall publish a Critical alarm for each of the following conditions related
//  to the overall integrity of the OSS:
//  * A PLC reports a controller fault, a module hardware fault, or a module communication fault,
//  * The GSC loses communication with a subsystem LSC,
//  * An estop, seismic, or fire event has occurred.
//
//  Discussion: A Critical alarm indicates to the operator that his attention is required immediately.
//  The health of the OSS becomes BAD due to a critical alarm.
//  Discussion: This information is used by ESW to provide OSS monitoring.
//
// Note: The severity values will be changed to match the CSW software in a future icd release
// Instead of [none, minor, major, invalid] they should be something like [Warning, Major, Indeterminate, Critical]
